      </h1>
      <h1>
          Let me be honest here:
          <br />
          You could be a boy.
          <br />
          There's nothing stopping you.
      </h1>

      <p>Is that really what you want?</p>

      <p>If you’re at this point, and if your wish is sincere, it’s because there’s some part of you that really wants to live as a man. And that’s totally okay. You can be a man if you want to, and we’ll help you get there.</p>

      <h2>Nothing&apos;s permanent about this decision.</h2>
      <p>If you decide you don&apos;t like it, you can always choose to stop being a boy. There is always a path back. <strong>Nobody but you can permanently change your gender,</strong> and nobody can trick you into wanting to be a boy if you didn't before. All we can do is help you reconnect with your own existing desire. No matter how you found this site, this is <strong>your decision.</strong> Nobody else should make it but you.</p>

      <p>You can always come back later if you’re not ready yet. <strong>You are 100% valid no matter what you choose.</strong></p>


      <p>If you’re ready, go make some tea, sit down in a quiet calm space, and give yourself as much time as you need.</p>

      <h2>If you&apos;re not sure, consider the following questions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Does imagining yourself as a man help you relate to other men?</li>
        <li>Do you wish your friends would see you and treat you as a man?</li>
        <li>Do you wish you could wear more masculine or &ldquo;cool&rdquo;/masculine-coded clothing? Do you find your assigned gender's clothing boring or unexpressive?</li>
        <li>Do you wish you could be seen as more masculine, with masculine-coded traits (&ldquo;cool&rdquo; or be seen as &ldquo;tough&rdquo;, &ldquo;brave&rdquo; or &ldquo;analytical&rdquo;)?</li>
        <li>Do you want to wake up tomorrow in a man’s body?</li>
        <li>Are you curious about what it must feel like to be a man and what men have to go through?</li>
        <li>Do you wish people would call you &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;him,&rdquo; or refer to you in more masculine ways? </li>
        <li>When you grow old, do you want to grow old in a man’s body?</li>
        <li>Do you have a big stupid grin on your face right now while reading this?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&#x261D; <strong>These are things that most men want,</strong> or at least most men who want a masculine-leaning presentation. People who aren&apos;t men don&apos;t generally want these things at all.</p>

      <p>Perhaps you don't necessarily want to be a <em>man</em> per sé or aren't sure how masculinely you want to present. <strong>Maybe you only know what you don't want</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you wish no one had ever known you as your assigned gender?</li>
        <li>Is it hard to relate to others as your assigned gender? (Example: <em>&ldquo;Being a woman never made any sense to me. I never understood how to relate to other women socially&rdquo;</em>)</li>
        <li>Do you frequently feel disconnected from the world, like a robot piloting a body of your assigned gender?</li>
        <li>Do you daydream about being someone else?</li>
        <li>Do you dislike your assigned name?</li>
        <li>If you&apos;ve gone through puberty, do you dislike the way that your voice, your face, or the shape of your body makes you appear more like your assigned gender?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&#x261D; If you find yourself relating to <em>any</em> these things, that could indicate that no matter who you are, <strong>you might be more comfortable living as a different gender</strong>. Maybe being a boy is right for you or maybe it's not, but there are ways to soothe these dysphoric feelings.
      </p>

<!--      <p>If all but one or two of the questions on this page match and you find yourself chuckling because those 1-2 non-matches <em>must mean</em> you're perfectly fine as you are&mdash;<em>nice try! ;)</em></p> -->

      <h2>Believe us, you're not the only one who feels this way.</h2>
      <p>
         <strong>Sometimes these feelings are tricky and difficult.</strong> Maybe you're worried about whether &ldquo;enough&rdquo; of them apply to you to do something about it, or about whether you &ldquo;deserve&rdquo; to address feelings that seem so superficially trivial.
         But that's the thing&mdash;these thoughts are slippery and hard to talk about, and they often affect people more deeply than they might seem to at first glance.
      </p>
      <h2>No matter how you answered these questions, you can be whoever you want to be.</h2>
      <p>
        We only give you these questions as guideposts in case you weren't already sure. None of them are necessary to be a boy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Everyone has the right to live as the gender that makes them the happiest in terms of roles / expressions in society.</strong>
      </p>
