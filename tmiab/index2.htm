          <div class="bgcol">
            <p>
              Perhaps you hadn't realized that you even <em>could</em> be a boy. Maybe you don't feel like one quite yet. Or maybe you even feel like you're not good enough to be a boy.</p><p><em>Don't worry about it too much!</em> All new boys are likely to have reservations.
              Here are some frequent newbie objections you may have:
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>

            <dl>

              <dt>But I don’t feel like a man!</dt>
              <dd><p>That’s OK, and it doesn’t change the fact that you could be a man inside. It’s totally normal not to feel like a man all the time. If you feel depressed or anxious because you don’t feel like a man but you wish you did, that feeling is called gender dysphoria, and we have some resources to help you manage this feeling below.</p></dd>


              <dt>But just because I want to be a man doesn’t mean that I actually can be one!</dt>
              <dd><p>As a fundamental truth, we hold that gender is always self-identified. In fact, self-identification is the only meaningful way to determine gender. This means that nobody but you can say whether you’re a man, a woman, or anything else. If there’s any part of you that wants to be a man, that could mean that you’re not comfortable with the gender you were assigned at birth. Please take a while to sit with that feeling and learn what it’s trying to tell you. Be what you wish you could be.</p>
              </dd>


              <dt>But I’m too old to be a man!</dt>
              <dd><p>Nobody’s too old to transition into a man’s life. People at the ages of 8, 28, and 80 have transitioned to live successful, fulfilling lives as men. The best time to start would have been when you were younger, but the second best time is today. You owe this to yourself no matter where and when you start from.</p></dd>


              <dt>But else nobody will ever see me as a man! I’ll never pass!</dt>
              <dd><p>Looking like a man according to society's standards is a skill that you can learn and practice. You’ll get better at learning what works for you and what doesn’t. Until you get the hang of it, focus on yourself! Just start with what makes you feel comfortable. Presenting masculinely is hard even for cis men to learn!</p></dd>


              <dt>But I don’t have the right to be a man!</dt>
              <dd><p>Everyone has the right to live as the gender that makes them the happiest in terms of roles / expressions in society. There’s no inherent value toward being male, just as there’s no inherent value in being female. The only person who benefits or is harmed by living as a man is you, so please don’t let yourself live as a martyr for society’s sake. We just want you to feel comfortable in your own skin. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p></dd>


              <dt>I don’t know if I want to be a man or if I just don’t want to be a woman!</dt>
              <dd><p>That’s totally valid. Maybe you might not be sure whether you’re drawn toward masculinity, or if you just want to avoid femininity.</p>

                <p>You don’t have to have all the answers yet. Just guide yourself toward whatever helps you feel more comfortable. If you find yourself feeling alienated by femininity but not necessarily attracted to masculinity, you could be nonbinary or gender nonconforming. That’s totally okay! This particular page centers the experiences of binary trans men, but you’re valid no matter how you identify. Maybe your answer might even change later as you come to understand yourself a little better.</p></dd>

              <dt>This is so stupid! What difference could a game on a website make?</dt>
              <dd><p>You’re right. We can’t magically alter your body or your memories over the Internet. But that’s not the point. We can’t make you wish you were a man, but we can help you re-discover  any pre-existing wish if you have one, and we can give you some advice to help you connect with that wish and nurture it if you want. Your wish to be a man is what matters in the end. Not some silly website game.</p>

                <p>Think about it this way: if you were secure living as your assigned gender, you’d be completely immune to all of this. You’d read this page, laugh, forget about it, and simply move on with your life. But if this sticks in your mind, sit with that feeling a little until you can understand what it’s trying to tell you.</p></dd>


              <dt>But I’m not sure if I want to be a man or if I’m just envious / jealous!</dt>
              <dd><p>What’s the difference? If you’re envious or jealous of the way men present themselves, relate to others, or live their lives, that jealousy itself could be trying to tell you something. Take a moment to consider what that might mean for you. It’s common for men who are just starting out to feel jealous of their more confident colleagues and peers. </p></dd>


              <dt>But I’m not gay / straight / bisexual / asexual / etc!</dt>
              <dd><p>That’s OK. Your gender and your sexual orientation are completely separate; they have nothing to do with each other. This is probably the hardest part for cis folks to understand: being trans doesn’t mean you’re gay, straight, or anything else. It is somewhat common for folks to repress sexual orientation at the same time as they repress their own gender identity, but we know trans folks who date men, women, nonbinary folks, anybody, or no one at all. It’s all totally fine.</p></dd>


              <dt>But being trans is a trend!</dt>
              <dd><p>If it is a trend, it’s a very old one. Trans people have existed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history">throughout all times in all cultures</a> but haven’t <a href="https://twitter.com/TransEthics/status/966892044663713793">enjoyed mainstream support and consciousness</a> until very recently.</p>
                
                <dt>But I never showed any signs during childhood!</dt>
                <dd><p>While some men may have known they were men from a very early age, it’s also very common to repress one’s own identity. It’s also extraordinarily common for signs to be present, but hidden until some hindsight well into manhood. Many men never showed any signs until age 20, 40, 60, or even older. Often some seemingly inconsequential event might bring those repressed feelings forward, and that’s totally okay. If you’re a late bloomer, don’t worry! You’re not any lesser than other men, you’re not an outsider, you’re just at the beginning of your path and there’s nothing wrong with that. The best time to plant a tree would have been twenty years ago, but the second best time is today.</p></dd>


                <dt>But I don’t want to alter my body!</dt>
                <dd><p>Then don't! Nobody's saying you have to. It’s very common for men not to want to change their bodies, especially at first. It’s also common for some of these feelings to change over time. However, being a man has absolutely nothing at all to do with your body -- it’s your desire to be a boy that makes you a boy, nothing more and nothing less.</p></dd>


                <dt>It seems nice, but I’m not completely certain I want to be a man!</dt>
                <dd><p>Nothing is permanent until you make it so; there is always a path back. Lots of us start with baby steps. It's okay to try something small, see how it feels, and then step back if it's not right for you.
                </p><p>
                    You’re absolutely valid, even if you don’t quite know what you want yet and even if you choose not to change anything about the way you express yourself. You don’t have to jump in and make huge irreversible changes right away. It’s totally okay to try some small reversible steps. If you later decide that something is not right for you, you can always back out, no matter where you are. As you continue on your path, you’ll begin to form a better idea of what you like and what you don’t.</p></dd>


                <dt>But I don’t want to lose everything when I come out!</dt>
                <dd><p>Many men are worried about losing their jobs, their friends, or the support of their family. There is some legitimacy behind this concern: about half of trans people can expect to lose a friend, and about one in four have lost a job due to bias and discrimination. However, most trans men who transition are glad they did and feel much more connected and secure.</p>

                    <p><strong>Underscoring all of this is the fact that your needs are what’s most important.</strong> If you don’t feel safe about telling others, it’s absolutely fine to keep your business to yourself. It’s much easier if you have friends or a supportive partner that can help you process, and you might be surprised by how many people will accept you, but many men get started completely on their own and only come out once they’re confident it’s the right choice for them.</p></dd>


                  <dt>But I still feel weird about this and have no one to talk to!</dt>
                  <dd><p>It’s totally normal to have questions. One of the best ways to understand what life as a man is like is to sit back and listen to many men’s experiences to get as many perspectives as possible.</p></dd>

            <h3>On "gender dysp<strong></strong>horia"</h3>
            <p>
              "Dysp<strong></strong>horia" is a general word that's broader than
              how the trans community typically uses it. It describes a dim, deeply
              felt sense that <em>something is wrong,</em> even if you don't necessarily understand why.
              Some people experience gender dys<strong></strong>phoria, which generally includes discomfort about how other people see them in gendered ways or having to relate to people in a way that doesn't feel right because of their gender.

              One of the many reasons why <strong>we stress that you don't need to be dys<strong></strong>phoric to still want to live as another gender</strong> is because gender dys<strong></strong>phoria is much more common than you might think.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Gender dys<strong></strong>phoria often imitates a more
                general dys<strong></strong>phoria about how you relate to
                people socially</strong>. If you want to understand the true
              nature of your dys<strong></strong>phoria, it's important to look
              deeply at your own fearsome heart and take an honest look at what
              you need to thrive. Will living as a different gender help you
              find surer footing in life? Will it at least give you some space
              to explore and experiment?
            </p>
            <p>
              &#x261D; Living as a different gender <strong>will not
                necessarily fix all of your dys<strong></strong>phoria or your ordinary
                depression.</strong> It isn't a silver bullet (see one <a
                                                                         href="https://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2014/03/darker-shades-of-pink-having-depression-when-youre-transgender/">example</a>). However, we find
              engaging with dys<strong></strong>phoria <strong>rather than
                turning away</strong> often gives people more breathing room, so
              they can take further steps more confidently.
            </p>
            <p>
              This feeling shows up in many ways, so we strongly encourage you
              to talk with other folks who've been through gender dysphoria and
              read through their experiences.
